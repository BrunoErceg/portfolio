### 🎯 Project Purpose

As a **Junior Developer**, I built this site to solve three main challenges:

- **Performance:** Ensuring fast load times and optimized asset delivery.
- **Clean Architecture:** Using centralized constant files and modular components for scalability.
- **UX/UI Excellence:** Implementing advanced CSS states and accessibility features.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **State Management:** React Hooks & Context API
- **Logic:** TypeScript / JavaScript (Clean Code principles)

### 🌟 Key Technical Features

- **Weather Logic:** Real-time data fetching with asynchronous state management.
- **Smart Components:** Modular, reusable architecture built for scalability and performance.
- **Visual Identity:** Custom-built typing effect with dynamic gradient highlights and animated borders.
- **Advanced UI:** Interactive systems (counters & states) showcasing deep React logic.
- **UX Animations:** High-performance, fluid transitions for an engaging user experience.
- **Contact System:** Functional form with integrated client-side validation.
