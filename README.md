### 🎯 Project Purpose

As a **Junior Developer**, I built this site to solve three main challenges:

- **Performance:** Ensuring fast load times and optimized asset delivery.
- **Clean Architecture:** Using centralized constant files and modular components for scalability.
- **UX/UI Excellence:** Implementing advanced CSS states and accessibility features.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

- **Core:** React.js / Vite
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **State Management:** React Hooks & Context API
- **Logic:** TypeScript / JavaScript (Clean Code principles)

### 🌟 Key Technical Features

- **Weather API Integration:** Implementing real-time data fetching and asynchronous state management to display live weather updates.
- **Complex Reusable Components:** Developed a modular component architecture, allowing for high scalability and code reusability across the project.
- **Advanced Logic Systems:** Built a complex counter system and interactive elements that demonstrate deep understanding of React state and logic.
- **Dynamic Animations:** Integration of complex, high-performance animations for a modern and engaging user experience.
- **Modern Contact System:** A fully functional contact form with client-side validation and clear user feedback.
